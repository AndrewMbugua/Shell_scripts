I had the idea of automating some minor system warning signs like battery low using a bash script.

I tried the various solutions that one can find online such as *modprobe pcspkr* and *echo -e '\a'* but non yielded the results I needed,so i chose for another path.Using the sound eXchange(sox) which supports most audio formats. Such as: wav, mp3, mpg, mp3, ogg, flac, etc

MY OS (Parrot OS was already equiped with sox but incase youtre reading this and yours doesnt have it just do the following:

$ sudo apt-get install sox
$ sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-all

congrats,now you have sox

To play all .mp3 files in any directory, change directory and use this command:

play *mp3 where *mp3 is the name of the song.
