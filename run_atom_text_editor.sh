# running atom woth the no sandbox flag via terminal

# After updating Atom text editor it seems I require to run --no-sandbox flag but after a while it becomes boring so I wrote a simple BASH script to be doing this for me:

eval "atom --no-sandbox flag"

# just save this in a common directory that you frequently use and type ./atom_text_editor.sh in the terminal to deploy(Depending on the name you choose for your script)
